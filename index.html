         <p class="description">The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.</p>

            <p class="about-discribe">Food safety (or food hygiene) is used as a scientific method/discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent food-borne illness. The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illnesses resulting from the ingestion of a common food is known as a food-borne disease outbreak.[1] This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potential health hazards. In this way, food safety often overlaps with food defense to prevent harm to consumers. The tracks within this line of thought are safety between industry and the market and then between the market and the consumer.</p>

      <p class="recipe-paragph">Adding a short introduction can draw the reader in and give them a clear idea of what they’ll be making. Briefly describe the flavors of the dish, why you like it, and any serving suggestions you have. You could also explain where you got the recipe (e.g., if it is adapted from another recipe).</p>

               <p class="food-paragph">
                  Perhaps the best known and most coveted dish from Puerto Rico, pernil is a positively sumptuous preparation for pork shoulder. It’s marinated (ideally overnight) in garlic, citrus and herbs, then slow-roasted on high heat to achieve a crisp chicharrón, or skin.

                  Tacos are crunchy, messy and great fun to eat, so it’s no wonder they’re a big hit with the kids. They’re also easy to make – more of an assembly job than a recipe.
